# Astar_maze_solver

A* is a generic search algorithm used to find solutions for several problems, maze solving basically to be one of them which is the process of plotting an efficiently traversable path between points. 
A* could possibly be the most popular pathfinding algorithm in game AI. A route with the lowest cost is found using the A* search algorithm implemented in C++ and later
improved on by coding in python.

## C++ Implementation 
open and run "4D.cpp"
### Maze
change "int grid[ROW][COL]"
1 represents a block
0 represents a path
### Start point
change "Pair src"
### End point
change "Pair dest"
### output
optimum solution path is printed

## Python Implementation
open and run the jupyter notebook "A_Star.ipynb"
### Maze, Start, End
change the variables "maze","start","end" as needed.
### output
run last cell to print output optimum path.
